The ultimate goal is to have this be both a web and mobile app (iOS).

I've decided to commit to using NextJS for this project for a few reasons.

1. It seems like a cohesive fullstack web framework with good documentation available.
2. Many people online seem to recommend it.
3. I already know the basics of React.
4. I haven't used it before. I consider this a reason to use it because in the real world I'll have to adapt to whatever my employer uses anyway, I'll be coming into it mostly blind and I won't necessarily have any experience with it.

One of my goals for the near future is to learn Typescript, from what I can see it makes JS into a typed language which I much prefer.
